# HashSet Data Structure

- **HashSet** is a data structure.
- **HashSet** is an efficient data structure because it takes constant time complexity:
    - To **add** -> `O(1)`
    - To **search** -> `O(1)`
    - To **remove** -> `O(1)`
- A **set** cannot contain duplicate values.
- **HashSet** is an **unordered** data structure.
- **HashSet** has no index, it contains only values.

## Common HashSet Functions

- `add()`
- `contains()`
- `size()`
- `remove()`

## Iterator Functions

- `next()`
- `hasNext()`

**Note**: The iterator's initial value is `null`. When it starts iterating, it begins with the first value and continues to the next one.
